~position property(relative, absolute, fixed):
relative: you can use the top,right,left,right property to move the element around its natrual position(top 10px moves down 10px, percentage to the parent element size is also support i think)
absolute: you move it based on the position of its first positioned parent
fixed: same with absolute but always based on the origin the of web browser, like the ad will always stay at the same place

major differnce of positon is that it will not influcen the positoning of its neighbor elements. but will step on them and obscure them.
